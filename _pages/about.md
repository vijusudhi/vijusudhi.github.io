Hi. This is Viju Sudhi.

I'm currently working as a Research Associate / PhD student at the Semantic Computing Group in Bielfeld University under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Philipp Cimiano.

**A bit about myself**

Developing a strong outlook in various areas of Natural Language Processing and Generation. Experienced in building and evaluating Generative Dialog Systems, fine-tuning Large Language Models and Retriever models. Equally intrigued to develop model-agnostic explainability techniques that can be used for all model architectures and use cases alike. A strong advocate of "Clean Code" - with a positive attitude to learning anything new!
