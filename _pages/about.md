Hi there. This is Viju Sudhi. 👋

I'm currently working as a Research Associate / PhD student at the [Semantic Computing Group](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/technische-fakultaet/arbeitsgruppen/semantic-computing/) in Bielefeld University under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Philipp Cimiano](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/technische-fakultaet/arbeitsgruppen/semantic-computing/team/philipp-cimiano/#comp_00005f3dd926_0000002992_051a).

**🧑‍💻 A bit about myself**

Developing a strong outlook in various areas of Natural Language Processing and Generation. Experienced in building and evaluating Generative Dialog Systems, fine-tuning Large Language Models and Retriever models. Equally intrigued to develop model-agnostic explainability techniques that can be used for all model architectures and use cases alike. A strong advocate of "Clean Code" - with a positive attitude to learning anything new!
